//Task 1: Obtaining API Key and Configuration
/* 
Obtain an API key from the Marvel Comics API website. Investigate and understand 
the necessary configurations required to authenticate requests to the API. 
You would need to generate a hash based off of the provide key combo 
in the documentation. 

I would recommend using https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/ to generate the hash.

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const apiHash = "YOUR_API_HASH";
const apiUrl = "https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters";


/*

Task 2: Fetching Characters Using Fetch API

Implement a function to fetch Marvel Comics characters asynchronously from the API 
endpoint using the Fetch API and promises. Utilize the API key 
and configurations obtained in Task 1. Log the fetched characters to the console.

*/

/*

Task 3: Updating User Interface Dynamically

Write a function to dynamically update the user interface with 
the fetched characters' information. 
Utilize promises and the Fetch API to ensure that the UI updates 
only after the characters are successfully fetched. */
